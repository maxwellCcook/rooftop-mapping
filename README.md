This repository contains all code and documentation for mapping roof material types (e.g., shingle, metal, slate, etc.) using multispectral satellite imagery from PlanetLabs SuperDove [ref] trained on a building footprint dataset which combines the Microsoft Building Footprints [ref] and the Zillow Transaction and Assessment Database (ZTRAX) which was used under a University license agreement [ref]. This work was supported by the Rutgers University Open Philanthropy Project, grant # 1433. Refereed manuscript in preparation.
